# Project Title: Locate an Object Based on Point Cloud Image

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust **3D object detection system** for LiDAR point cloud data, capable of identifying and localizing objects such as **automobiles and pedestrians** in 3D space. The system is based on the **YOLO architecture**, extended to work with 3D data by transforming point clouds into **Bird's Eye View (BEV)** maps and predicting **3D bounding boxes**.

The model is designed for **real-time detection**, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency, even in complex environments like **parking lots** or **urban areas**.

## Key Features

- **3D Object Detection**: Capable of detecting objects in 3D space, including dimensions like height, width, depth, and orientation.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized to run efficiently in real-time or near-real-time scenarios.
- **Scalability & Flexibility**: Adaptable to different LiDAR datasets and varying environmental conditions.
- **Small Object Detection**: Enhanced accuracy for detecting small and distant objects in sparse 3D point cloud data.

## Project Objectives

1. **Accurate Object Detection**: Develop a system that accurately detects and locates objects within point cloud data.
2. **Feature Extraction Techniques**: Explore and evaluate methods such as **PointNet++**, **RCNN variants**, and **voxelization** for feature extraction.
3. **Real-Time Optimization**: Ensure the model is efficient for practical deployment in real-world environments, maintaining a balance between **speed and accuracy**.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Utilize the **KITTI dataset** for gathering 3D LiDAR point cloud data of the environment.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Filtering**: Remove noise and irrelevant data points.
- **Segmentation**: Segment the point cloud into distinct objects.
- **Normalization**: Align the data with a common coordinate system.

### 3. Feature Extraction
- Convert the preprocessed point cloud data into:
  - **Voxel Grid View**
  - **Bird's Eye View (BEV)**
- Use deep learning models such as **PointNet++**, **R-CNN**, and **PointNet** for feature extraction.

### 4. Object Detection
- Employ **3D YOLO** for object detection using both Voxel Grid and BEV views.
- Alternatively, use **Complex YOLO** for refined detection in complex environments.

### 5. Validation and Testing
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like **Intersection over Union (IoU)**, **precision**, and **recall**.
- Conduct real-world tests to ensure robustness.

## Dataset

- **KITTI dataset**: [Link to KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3D-object-detection-point-cloud.git
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the KITTI dataset and organize it in the appropriate directory.

## Model Training

1. Preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset kitti --epochs 50 --batch-size 8
   ```

3. Validate the model:
   ```bash
   python validate.py
   ```

## Results

The system's performance will be evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**
- **Real-time Processing Speed**
